# From Tokyo to Fukuoka: Island Switch

Changing cities in Japan always mixes logistics, anticipation and that hint of uncertainty that accompanies every traveller. After several days in Tokyo, the moment arrives to say goodbye to the capital and head south, to Kyushu, Japan’s third‑largest island. Fukuoka waits on the other side of the sky, bringing a completely different atmosphere: less vertical, more intimate, with a rhythm inviting you to breathe slower. The day starts in Asakusa, picking up luggage from the hotel and preparing for a flight that will last only two hours but will connect two distinct worlds.

## RESOL POSHTEL TOKYO ASAKUSA

The morning begins with final checks before leaving accommodation in Asakusa. RESOL POSHTEL TOKYO ASAKUSA has been the base of operations during these days in the capital, and although the stay is ending, it deserves a brief reflection. Guests who have passed through this establishment highlight its privileged location, just minutes from Sensoji and perfectly connected to the subway. Rooms, though compact as usual in Tokyo, are well equipped and staff is attentive and efficient.

Check‑out is quick, no last‑minute surprises. The hostel offers luggage storage until noon, but that was not needed here. With the suitcase closed and passport in pocket, it’s time to head to the airport. From Asakusa, the Ginza line connects with the Asakusa line, from which you can take a direct train to Haneda Airport. The journey takes about an hour, enough to mentally review the day’s itinerary and anticipate what awaits in Fukuoka.

## CANAL CITY HAKATA

The flight lands on time at Fukuoka Airport, and within fifteen minutes of metro travel, Hakata Station welcomes the newly arrived. Fukuoka is a city presented without clamor: wide, orderly, with a more relaxed air than Tokyo yet still retaining that touch of modernity characteristic of major Japanese metropolises. The first destination after dropping off luggage is Canal City Hakata, a commercial and entertainment complex described as a city within a city.

Opened in 1996, Canal City Hakata was designed by American architect Jon Jerde, the same person behind other iconic projects such as Roppongi Hills in Tokyo and Namba Parks in Osaka. The complex spans nearly 44 000 square metres and its main feature is the artificial canal that cuts it from side to side, flanked by buildings with curved shapes and bright colours contrasting with the more sober architecture elsewhere. Water flows between fountains and cascades, and each hour a water‑light‑sound show attracts hundreds of curious onlookers.

Inside the complex are over 250 shops, restaurants, cinemas, a theatre and even a five‑star hotel, Grand Hyatt Fukuoka. The commercial offering is varied: from international fashion stores to unique Japanese establishments, including a huge Muji store, a Ghibli study space and another for Sanrio with Hello Kitty as the star. On the fifth floor sits Ramen Stadium, a cluster of eight ramen stalls representing different styles from across Japan, including the famous Hakata ramen, the local style prepared with pork‑bone broth and fine noodles.

Walking through Canal City feels like being carried by its festive atmosphere. It’s not a conventional mall; it’s an area designed for strolling, entertainment and surprise. Escalators snake between levels, bridges cross the canal at several points, and benches invite you to sit and watch people come and go. It works just as well for shopping, grabbing a quick bite or simply passing time aimlessly.

## Smile Hotel – Hakata Ekimae

After exploring Canal City, it’s time to head to the hotel where you’ll spend the night. The Smile Hotel Hakata Ekimae is just minutes on foot from Hakata Station, making it a comfortable and practical base for moving around Fukuoka. Guests who have left reviews of this establishment agree on its excellent value, immaculate cleanliness of rooms and staff friendliness.

Rooms are functional, with simple yet thoughtful décor, and include everything needed for a comfortable stay: air conditioning, flat‑screen TV, mini‑fridge and private bathroom. The hotel offers check‑in from 3 p.m. and check‑out until 11 a.m., plus vending machines in the lobby, free Wi‑Fi and a small paid continental breakfast that, according to comments, is adequate but not especially memorable.

What’s most valued about Smile Hotel is its strategic location. From here you can walk to most points of interest in central Fukuoka: Kushida Shrine, Nakasu district, Canal City and the Tenjin commercial area all within twenty minutes on foot. For those preferring public transport, Hakata Station connects with subway and local buses in a matter of minutes.

## Kushida Shrine

With the hotel settled, the afternoon invites you to explore Hakata’s historic core. A few steps from accommodation is Kushida Shrine, one of the city’s most beloved and respected temples. Locally affectionately called Okushida‑san, this Shinto shrine was founded in 1757 when Hakata was a flourishing port receiving embassies and merchants from China and Korea.

Kushida’s history dates back to Emperor Koken’s era, when it was decided to build a shrine sharing a deity with the Kushida Temple of Ise province, now Mie Prefecture. In the sixteenth century Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered reconstruction of the main building that still stands today. The shrine is dedicated to three Shinto deities: Amaterasu Omikami, the sun goddess and mythical ancestor of the imperial family; Ohatanushi no Mikoto, a deity associated with earth; and Susanoo no Mikoto, the impetuous storm god.

The shrine’s precincts are a haven of tranquility amid urban bustle. Access is through a stone torii darkened by time, decorated with a plaque reading Kushida no Miya. Crossing the threshold, the ambience changes: ancient trees filter sunlight, stone lanterns line both sides of the path and car noise is muted by leaf rustle.

One emblematic element is the huge ginkgo rising in the centre. With over a thousand years of age, this tree is considered a cultural treasure of Fukuoka Prefecture and appears in traditional Hakata songs. In autumn its leaves turn golden yellow, covering the ground with a bright carpet that attracts photographers and walkers.

Near the entrance sits a purification fountain called reisen, surrounded by three bronze cranes. Tradition says drinking from it grants longevity and eternal youth, though for those already aged it’s more symbolic than effective. The fountain is adorned with aquatic plants and koi swimming lazily beneath the afternoon sun.

Kushida Shrine is also the centre of Hakata Gion Yamakasa festival, one of Fukuoka’s most important events celebrated every July for over seven hundred years. During the festival, teams of men carry huge decorated floats called yamakasa that can reach ten metres tall and weigh more than a ton. The floats are adorned with historical figures and scenes; the climax is the Oiyama race where teams compete through Hakata’s streets carrying floats on their shoulders. One float remains displayed all year in shrine grounds, except June when it’s removed for maintenance.

Strolling at Kushida offers a chance to disconnect from city pace and connect with Japan’s spiritual side. The shrine isn’t especially large but has charisma, history and that aura of authenticity found only where time seems halted.

## Kawataro Nakasu

After visiting the shrine, the stomach starts to call for attention. Evening falls and it’s the perfect moment to dive into Nakasu district, Fukuoka’s nightlife heart. Nakasu is a small island between the Nakagawa and Hakatagawa rivers; in its two square kilometres are over three thousand establishments – restaurants, bars and more seedy entertainment venues. But what truly makes Nakasu famous are the yatai, street‑food stalls that set up each night along the river.

Before reaching the yatai there’s time for a formal dinner at Kawataro Nakasu, a restaurant specialising in traditional Japanese cuisine. The venue sits on one of Nakasu’s main streets near Fuku‑Haku Deai Bridge and offers dishes such as tempura, sashimi, yakitori and, of course, ramen. Atmosphere is calm, with dark wooden décor and low lights inviting relaxation after an intense day.

Service is attentive without being intrusive; food arrives with the precision that characterises quality Japanese restaurants. The ramen is hearty, a thick tonkotsu broth comforting with noodles at just the right firmness. Pairing dinner with a local beer is almost mandatory, and the restaurant’s overall ambience makes it easy to lose track of time while enjoying the meal.

## Fuku‑Haku Deai Bridge

After dinner, night in Nakasu is only beginning. A few metres from the restaurant stands the 78‑metre pedestrian bridge crossing the Naka River, linking Nakasu and Nishi‑Nakasu. The name is symbolic: “Fuku” refers to Fukuoka, the city of samurais during Edo, while “Haku” references Hakata, the merchants’ city. “Deai” means meeting, so the full name translates as the bridge of encounter between Fukuoka and Hakata.

The bridge’s design is peculiar. Its railings display figures resembling inverted cups crossed by spears – a nod to an old samurai story linked to Nihongo, one of Japan’s three great spears. According to legend, four hundred years ago a Kuroda clan vassal named Mori Tahei was sent as messenger to Hiroshima’s lord Masanori, who possessed this famed spear. Masanori, known for his love of drink, challenged Tahei to a sake duel: if the messenger could out‑drink him, he could request any reward. Tahei accepted, won and claimed the legendary spear as prize. This curious episode was immortalised in a popular song called Kuroda bushi, and today bridge decorations honour that story.

Crossing the Fuku‑Haku Deai at night is visual. Yellow lights illuminating the structure reflect on river water; from the bridge you can see the Fukuoka skyline silhouetted against dark sky. On both sides of the river, yatai begin to set up, paper lanterns hanging from canvas roofs and grill smoke spiralling upward. The ambience is festive, noisy, authentic. Patrons crowd small stools around stalls, chatting with cooks, sipping sake and sampling yakitori skewers, fresh gyoza and, naturally, Hakata ramen.

Yatai are an institution in Fukuoka. While other Japanese cities also have them, this city maintains the tradition strongest. Stalls open from six p.m. and stay active until early morning, offering quick, hot and affordable food. Sitting at a yatai is not just culinary but social: it’s where office workers vent after work, tourists mingle with locals and conversations flow as freely as sake.

The riverside walk is the perfect closing for this first day in Fukuoka. Air is fresher than Tokyo; city feels more human, closer. Fewer skyscrapers, more open spaces, a general sense of being somewhere where breathing still can be unhurried. Kyushu has its own rhythm, and Fukuoka is its gateway.

Night progresses and slowly it’s time to return to the hotel. Tomorrow will bring more exploration of this city revealing its character. But this first impression is clear: Fukuoka differs, and that was exactly what we sought when leaving Tokyo.
