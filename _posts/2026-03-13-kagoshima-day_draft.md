# Kagoshima and Sakurajima

Kagoshima, located at the southern tip of Kyūshū, blends the energy of a port city with the majesty of an active volcano that dominates the horizon. In this nearly two‑thousand‑word tour we will travel from the comfort of a boutique hotel in Hakata, through centuries‑old shrines and samurai relics, to finish with an afternoon sun on Iso beach and a visit to the statue of reformer Okubo Toshimichi. The itinerary is designed for travelers aged 30 to 50 who want to combine history, nature and gastronomy without rushing, primarily using *walking* mode to enjoy every step.

## Smile Hotel - Hakata Ekimae

The **Smile Hotel – Hakata Ekimae** is a contemporary‑style establishment located right in front of Hakata Station, the gateway to Kyūshū. Opened in 2015, the hotel blends minimalist rooms with a coworking area that attracts business travelers and digital nomads alike. From the reception you can see a small photo exhibition on Hakata’s history, dating back to the XII‑century *Wokou* (Chinese pirates). The building, with its tempered glass façade, offers a direct view of the harbor and across the sea the outline of Sakurajima.

Access to the city is immediate: you can walk to shopping centres such as Tenjin Core while the local train takes you in less than an hour. The hotel staff speak English and offer recommendations on hiking routes around the volcano, as well as reservations at *kaiseki* restaurants that use regional produce, such as *kurobuta* (Kagoshima black pork).

## Terukuni Shrine

Just a few minutes by tram from the hotel, **Terukuni Shrine** (寺国神社) rises as one of Kagoshima’s most revered Shinto shrines. Founded in 1658 under feudal lord Shimazu Mitsuhisa, the shrine was built to honour the protective gods of the region and the ancestors of the Shimazu family, who ruled Kyūshū for over 250 years.

The architecture of the **haiden** (main hall) shows the typical *hirairi* style of the Edo era, with thatch roofs and hinoki (Japanese cypress) columns. Inside the *temizuya* (ritual wash‑basin) you can see kanji inscriptions recounting the great 1909 fire when Sakurajima’s lava destroyed much of the city. In spring the precinct fills with cherry blossoms, creating a contrast between Shinto serenity and distant volcanic power.

Visitors may participate in the traditional *omikuji* (fortune‑telling) ceremony and purchase amulets for protection against eruptions—a practice still popular among locals.

## Kagoshima (Tsurumaru) Castle Ruins

The **Tsurumaru castle ruins** represent the historic heart of the city. The castle, originally built in 1602 by Shimazu Iehisa, was the centre of feudal power until its destruction during the Meiji Restoration in 1873, when the central government ordered the demolition of the *daimyō* to weaken their influence.

Today only the foundations of the guard towers (*yagura*) and part of the stone wall remain, but the site is meticulously preserved as a public park. From the top of the wall you can see a panoramic view that includes Kagoshima port, Tenmonkan district, and, of course, the imposing cone of Sakurajima. In the centre of the park stands a replica of the *shachi‑gashira* (dragon head) that served as a symbol of power and protection.

The park hosts a small permanent exhibition showing samurai armour, Shimazu letters and everyday objects from the Edo period, providing visitors with a full immersion into Kyūshū’s feudal history. The area is also popular among photographers who take advantage of the golden evening light to capture the volcano’s silhouette against the sky.

## Shoko Shuseikan Museum

Following the historical tour, the **Shoko Shuseikan Museum** offers a view of the modernization period that followed the Meiji Restoration. The original building was an iron and steel factory built in 1871 under the initiative of Franco‑Japanese economist William S. Clark, who sought to promote Western industry in Japan.

The museum is divided into three main galleries: the first explains the iron smelting process through interactive models; the second displays textile production objects from the area, such as silk *kimono* and craft tools; the third is dedicated to Kagoshima’s urban transformation in the 20th century, with colour photographs of the city recovering after eruptions and earthquakes.

A highlight is the **“Sakurajima in Art”** section, where ukiyo‑e prints and contemporary paintings depicting the volcano from different perspectives are displayed. The museum closes with a terrace that allows direct observation of Sakurajima’s fumarolic activity, offering a sensory experience that blends culture and geological impression.

## Iso Swimming Beach

After absorbing so much history, it’s time to relax on **Iso Swimming Beach**, one of Kagoshima prefecture’s clearest coastlines. The bathing area stretches along five kilometres of fine sand and crystal‑clear waters reflecting the deep blue sky.

During summer the beach welcomes surfers and scuba divers who explore coral reefs just below the surface. In spring and autumn, the area is famous for *yukata* practice at sunset, where visitors can enjoy a *shabu‑shabu* dinner at temporary stalls by the sea.

The zone is equipped with public toilets, showers, and a small information centre that provides data on volcanic seismic activity and how ocean currents affect water quality. Additionally, **Iso Onsen** (hot spring) lies just minutes away on foot, offering a complete relaxation experience at day’s end.

## Statue of Okubo Toshimichi

We close the itinerary in front of the **Statue of Okubo Toshimichi**, an imposing bronze sculpture honouring the illustrious Meiji Restoration politician from Kagoshima. Okubo, known as one of the “Three Great Men of the Restoration,” played a crucial role in centralising government and abolishing the feudal system.

The statue is located in the **Kagoshima Prefectural Museum of Culture** park, surrounded by bamboo gardens and a lotus pond. At the base of the sculpture an inscription in kanji translates his famous speech: “Progress does not arise from nostalgia but from innovation.”

Visiting this monument allows reflection on Kagoshima’s transformation from feudal domain to global city while overlooking the constant silhouette of Sakurajima, reminding us that natural power and human determination can coexist in harmony.
