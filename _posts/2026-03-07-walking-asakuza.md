# My Day in Asakusa and Its Hidden Treasures

When I plan a trip to Tokyo, Asakusa is always among my top priorities. It’s not just a tourist neighborhood: I feel it’s one of the few places where you can breathe the history of old Edo times, mixed with a very lively local vibe. In this route I’ll share what I discovered, with historical facts, curiosities and moments that stayed etched in me.

## Asakusa Nishi-sandō Shopping Street: A Soulful Stroll

I started my day walking along **Asakusa Nishi-sandō**, a traditional commercial gallery just west of the Sensō-ji temple. At first glance it looks like any other shopping street, but it has a deep history: part of this street has been renovated to reflect a festive atmosphere, with wood, lanterns and architecture evoking traditional festivals.

What caught my eye was that, although very touristy, it doesn’t feel “manufactured” for the traveler: there are still local shops, traditional sweets and displays that could have existed decades ago. Perfect for chatting with vendors, hunting for authentic souvenirs and grabbing a bite between temple and temple.

## Sensō-ji: More Than a Temple, A Living Symbol

Visiting **Sensō-ji** was one of the most powerful moments of the day for me. [*ayer*]({{ "/japón/arriving-tokio/" | relative_url }}) I had already been here, so that’s why I returned. This temple, the oldest in Tokyo, traces its roots to a legend dating back to 628, when two fisherman brothers (Hinokuma Hamanari and Takenari) pulled a golden Kannon statue from the Sumida River. That statue is the foundation of this temple’s devotion.

A curiosity that fascinated me: the original image of Kannon **is never shown to the public**. It’s hidden (hibutsu), according to tradition, giving it an air of mystery.

The temple has undergone many reconstructions: it was completely destroyed during World War II bombings in 1945, but rebuilt again in 1958. The roof of the main building is now titanium, blending tradition with innovation.

I was also surprised by how the temple relates to political power: during the Tokugawa shogunate, Sensō-ji was declared the official temple of the Tokugawas, boosting its growth. And one of the neighborhood’s most colorful moments, **Sanja Matsuri**, has roots in very ancient rituals linked to this temple.

Nakamise-dōri immediately captivated me: it’s short, but each shop offers something unique, from traditional sweets to crafts that feel from another era. I stopped more than once to admire details, try a snack and simply soak up the atmosphere. It’s a stroll best enjoyed slowly, looking around rather than rushing.

## Asakusa Shrine: Sintoist Tradition Just Next Door

Just steps from Sensō-ji, I found the **Asakusa Shrine** (Asakusa Jinja), which honors the same fisherman brothers who discovered the Kannon statue, as well as Haji no Nakamoto. It’s interesting because it’s one of the few historic buildings that **survived the 1945 bombings**, making it a symbol of resilience.

It was built in 1649 by Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu during the Edo period, and its architectural style is gongen‑zukuri, typical of important Sintoist shrines.

For me, it represented a tranquil pause: between the bustle of the Buddhist temple and souvenir shops, this shrine offers a calm oasis of spirituality.

## Asakusa Hanayashiki: Nostalgia in Motion

A fun part of my tour was **Asakusa Hanayashiki**, an amusement park with a very Japanese retro aesthetic. The interesting thing is that this park has historical roots: a similar play area existed since the 19th century as part of Asakusa’s entertainment evolution.

I loved riding some small attractions because they transport you to another era: they’re not modern roller‑coasters, but they have that old‑school charm that big parks lack. Whether you go with your partner, friends or family, it’s a very authentic way to “experience traditional + playful Asakusa”.

## Taito Parks: Recharge Between History and Silence

After the bustle, I needed a break, so I went to **Taito Kuritsu Fuji Park** and then to **Taito Kuritsu Nihonzutsumi Park**. They’re modest parks, but for me they were a surprise: ideal for resting, grabbing something from the konbini (convenience store) or simply sitting to watch locals go about their daily lives.

What I liked most is that they’re not “tourist attractions”: there are no grand monuments, but you get that feeling of a lively neighborhood with families, bicycles, elderly reading… perfect for a traveler seeking a bit of peace amid the city.

## Yoshiwara: The Hidden Past Behind the Beauty

Yoshiwara Park and **Yoshiwara Shrine** were among my deepest discoveries. Yoshiwara’s area holds enormous historical weight: during Edo, it was the city’s most famous pleasure district.

Although today it’s a quiet neighborhood, feeling that you’re walking where centuries ago a controversial part of Japanese society thrived gave me a different perspective. The shrine is small, but offering my prayers there felt like honoring an important past. If you’re interested in Tokyo’s more “dark” and complex history, this place is very revealing.

## Local Gastronomy: A Stop at Men Mitsui

When I was already hungry, I went to **Men Mitsui**, a small noodle restaurant. It’s not just a place to eat: it has that traditional atmosphere, with home‑made flavors and noodles prepared with care. As a traveler, I love stepping into local spots rather than tourist chains, and this restaurant gave me exactly that: authenticity and great ramen/soba.

## Kappabashi Dougu-gai: For Cooking Enthusiasts

After lunch, I walked to **Kappabashi**, Tokyo’s famous “kitchenware city”. I was impressed by the number of shops selling everything from handcrafted knives to plastic food replicas you see in restaurant displays. According to local guides, professional chefs come here to shop, giving an idea of the level of equipment available.

As a traveler interested in gastronomy, this place is a gem: you can take home a spectacular and functional souvenir, or simply enjoy looking at molds, utensils and objects rarely seen outside Japan.

## Yanaka Ginza: Nostalgia and Time Stopped

I ended my day in **Yanaka Ginza**, a place that stole my heart with its simplicity. This commercial street is located in the Yanaka neighborhood, one of those Tokyo areas that feels frozen in another era: many old houses, small cafés, family shops, artisans.

Historically, what’s interesting is that Yanaka (and the entire Yanesen district: Yanaka‑Nezu‑Sendagi) survived WWII bombings relatively well, giving it an authentic “old Tokyo” character.

While walking through Yanaka Ginza, I came across street food stalls, crafts and small temple shops. It’s a perfect spot to close the day with an intimate, genuine feeling, away from major tourist flows.
