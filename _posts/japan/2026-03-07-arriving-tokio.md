# Arrival in Tokyo

I just landed in Japan, and this first day in Tokyo was pure vertigo, excitement, and first impressions. From the airport to the city center and ending with an immersion into the most traditional side of Tokyo, this initial walk is ideal for a solid start in the Japanese capital.

## Narita International Airport

Arriving at Narita International Airport (NRT) means landing at Japan's main international gateway. It lies about 60 km east of Tokyo and handles much of the international passenger traffic to the capital.

Narita is a sprawling airport with three terminals—two for regular flights and one dedicated to low‑cost carriers—connected by free shuttle buses or pedestrian walkways. It’s comfortable if you arrive after a long flight: it offers extensive services, duty‑free shops, rest areas, and good connections to central Tokyo.

**Practical tip:** to reach the city center as quickly as possible, it’s best to use a rapid train or a limousine service if you’re in a hurry or want to make the most of your day without wasting time.

## Transfer to the Center: Keisei Ueno Station

From Narita you can take a direct train to Keisei Ueno Station, an underground station located beneath Ueno Park that quickly connects to Tokyo’s heart. Operated by the Keisei company, this station opened in 1933 and adopted its current name in 1953.

The surrounding area is vibrant: Ueno is a lively neighborhood filled with museums, parks, and shopping streets. It’s an ideal spot to drop off luggage, stretch your legs, and start absorbing the city’s urban rhythm as soon as you arrive.

## A Symbolic Walk: Hidesaburō Ueno and Hachikō Statue

Just a few minutes from Ueno is a very special statue: one that depicts Professor Hidesaburō Ueno alongside his dog Hachikō. This sculpture, inaugurated in 2015 at the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Tokyo, honors one of the country’s most famous loyalty stories.

The story is moving: Hachikō, an Akita‑breed dog, would accompany his owner to the station every day. After Professor Ueno’s sudden death in 1925, the dog continued to go to the same place to wait for him for nearly ten years. Over time he became a national symbol of fidelity.

This visit has a quieter and more intimate atmosphere than other tourist spots. It’s a good moment to pause, breathe, and connect with a story that is part of Japanese collective imagination.

## Evening Finale in Asakusa: Sensō-ji

To close the day I decided to head to Asakusa and visit Sensō-ji, Tokyo’s oldest Buddhist temple and one of its most recognizable symbols. Its origins date back to 645 AD, and despite time, fires, and reconstructions, it remains one of the most vibrant spots in traditional Tokyo.

Upon arriving at Sensō‑ji, the first thing that struck me is the Kaminarimon Gate with its gigantic red lantern. It’s impressive, and I couldn’t resist taking a bunch of photos. Passing through it, the bustle of tourists mingles with the scent of incense, giving you a sense of stepping into something special.

## What I Take Away from This First Day?

This start in Tokyo has helped me settle calmly, get acquainted with urban life, and gradually immerse myself in Japanese history and culture. From Narita’s international hustle to Asakusa’s spiritual calm, passing through Hachikō’s moving story, it was a day full of perfect contrasts for beginning the journey.
