# Beppu and its Infernos: A Journey Through Kyushu's Thermal Waters

Leaving Hakata early in the morning bound for Beppu feels like traveling to Japan’s geothermal heart. This coastal city in Oita Prefecture is world‑renowned for having the largest volume of hot spring water on Earth, with over 2,000 active springs erupting from Kyushu’s volcanic depths. What began as a round trip from Fukuoka turned into an immersive experience in a landscape where steam rises everywhere and sulfur scent perfumes the air.

## Kamado Jigoku: The Caldera Hell

The moment you arrive at Kannawa, the first thing that hits you is the sheer amount of vapor escaping from every corner. Kamado Jigoku, known as the Caldera Hell, owes its name to an old legend in which rice was cooked using 98 °C natural steam as a offering to the Kamado Hachimangu shrine. Built in 727, this shrine lies nearby and forms part of local folklore that links a reformed demon who now guards these infernal waters.

The site has six distinct districts, each with its own geothermal personality. There are crystal‑blue ponds reminiscent of the sea, bubbling mud pools that sound as if someone is farting, and fumaroles that eject columns of vapor with impressive force. The most curious thing is that you can interact with the onsen: there are demonstrations where steam is used to create visual effects, you can drink mineral water straight from the source (with a metallic, sulfurous taste), and even soak your feet in free thermal baths.

The culinary experience also contributes to the attraction. The famous “Onsen Piitan” are eggs boiled for 24 hours in geothermal steam, giving them a unique color and flavor. I bought several because they were truly delicious, and saw two people buying 16 all at once. They also sell soy pudding and other items cooked with natural heat.

A detail many are unaware of: if you show your ticket at this counter, you can access a private onsen called “Iyashinoyu” for free. Just ask for the key, enjoy the bath, return it, and that’s it. It’s a hidden gem originally built for family use but now available to visitors.

## The Jigoku Circuit: Exploring Beppu's Infernos

After Kamado Jigoku, the tour continues through other equally impressive infernos. The largest is Umi Jigoku (Sea Hell), with its cobalt‑blue waters reaching depths of 200 m. Despite its beauty, the water boils at temperatures above 100 °C, making bathing impossible.

Yama Jigoku (Mountain Hell) is less visually spectacular but impresses with vapor columns filtering through every crevice on the hillside. Chinoike Jigoku (Blood Pond Hell) stands out for its intense red color produced by iron oxide, and is considered the oldest of all Japanese infernos.

The eight infernos can be visited with a combined ticket for 2,000 yen, valid for two consecutive days. If you have the “Be Beppu” brochure sold for 500 yen at the station’s tourist office, you get a 10% discount and a free egg at Kamado Jigoku. The full route takes between 2 and 3 hours on foot, as five of them are concentrated in Kannawa district and two in Shibaseki.

## Beppu Onsen Hoyoland: The Volcanic Mud Experience

After exploring the infernos, it was time to experience Beppu’s most authentic adventure: soaking in hot volcanic mud. Hoyoland is one of the few places in Japan where you can apply volcanic sludge directly while bathing in outdoor thermal waters.

The place looks quite rustic on the outside, which may deter some visitors, but don’t be fooled by appearances. For 1,100 yen you gain access to different types of baths: indoor onsens with milky water rich in colloids and sulfur (between 42 and 45 °C), gender‑separated mud baths indoors, and the famous mixed outdoor mud bath.

The mud experience is unique. It’s not an artificial spa treatment; it’s genuine volcanic sludge that you can scoop from the pool bottom and apply all over your body. It acts as a natural exfoliant and mineral mask, leaving skin incredibly smooth. The water’s pH is extremely acidic (2.5), giving it exceptional therapeutic properties for skin issues.

The outdoor mixed bath is discreetly designed: women have a closed entrance that lets them soak before entering the common area, and the turbid mud water makes it impossible to see anything once inside. A bamboo fence symbolically divides the zones, though in the end everyone shares the same thermal space surrounded by nature.

Be careful with jewelry: mineral‑rich water can oxidize metals. It’s also advisable to bring a large towel because you’ll come out soaked and heated, and the small onsen towel isn’t enough to dry properly.

## Beppu Park: A Green Respite in the Center

After so much geothermal heat, a walk through Beppu Park was wonderful. This expansive 27‑hectare park opened in 1907 for Emperor Taisho’s visit, and the pines planted then still thrive over a century later.

The park is a perfect urban oasis to rest. There are paths winding between bamboo groves, playground areas, picnic spots, and strategically placed benches to admire the vegetation. In spring it blooms with cherry trees, while in autumn the trees shift to spectacular crimson and golden hues. Wisteria blooms from April to May, creating purple curtains hanging over the paths.

In the park’s heart lies a stone marking Beppu’s geographic center, excavated during maintenance works in the Meiji era. Walking through the entire park takes about 30 minutes at a relaxed pace. At this entrance is a modern Starbucks with an open atmosphere, ideal for grabbing something before continuing.

## Beppu Station: The Connection Point

Beppu Station is more than just a transit hub; it’s the nerve center from which routes to all city attractions are organized. It has a well‑equipped tourist office selling bus passes, detailed maps, and the “Be Beppu” brochure that includes discount coupons and free entries to various onsens.

From here buses 2, 5, 24, and 41 depart for Kannawa district (stop “Kannawa” or “Umi-Jigoku‑mae”) in about 20 minutes for 330 yen. To reach Hoyoland you need lines 5 or 7 and disembark at “Hoyoland Mae” after 25 minutes.

The station also hosts food stalls where you can try local specialties like toriten (chicken tempura) or dangojiru (meatball soup). It’s the perfect spot to recharge before heading back.

## From Beppu to Oita: Closing a Thermal Day

The return journey via Oita Station is short but allows you to admire Kyushu’s coast. Oita, the prefecture’s capital, has a more urban feel than Beppu, though less touristy. Many visitors use it as an alternative base for exploring the region.

The Limited Express Sonic‑Nichirin connects Beppu with Hakata in about two hours, stopping at Oita. The ticket costs 5,680 yen if you don’t have a JR Pass, but the journey is included if you do. Trains are comfortable and punctual, perfect for relaxing after an intense day of walking and baths.

Returning to Smile Hotel at Hakata Ekimae, I felt complete satisfaction. I’d traversed some of the world’s most impressive geothermal landscapes, immersed myself in authentic volcanic mud (something that makes you feel connected to the earth in a very special way), and confirmed why Beppu is considered the world capital of hot springs.

The onsens were, without doubt, amazing. Not only for the therapeutic properties of mineral‑rich water but also for the complete cultural experience: from pre‑bath cleansing rituals to sharing an outdoor mixed bath surrounded by steam and nature. It’s something rarely found outside Japan, let alone with Beppu’s geothermal intensity.
