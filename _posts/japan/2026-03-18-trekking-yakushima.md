## Yakushima Green Hotel

The day starts before dawn to make use of daylight hours on the mountain. From Yakushima Green Hotel in Anbo hikers must take a special bus to the Yakusugi Museum. This service begins operating around 4:30 am.

The special mountain bus runs from the Yakusugi Museum to the start of the Arakawa trail between March and November. During these months private vehicle access is restricted to reduce environmental impact. Tickets must be purchased in advance at tourist information centres or directly at the museum.

## Arakawa Three‑way Junction

The three‑way junction marks an important point on Yakushima’s old forest routes. These railways were built during the Taisho and Showa periods to transport yakusugi cedar logs from the mountains. The rails were used until the mid‑twentieth century when intensive logging ceased.

Hikers walk over the restored tracks for about eight kilometres of the total route. The terrain is relatively flat in this initial section, allowing a good pace. Some tunnels cut through rock formations still preserving original sleepers between the rails.

## Arakawa Trail Start

The official start of the Arakawa trail sits 950 m above sea level. From here the main route begins towards Jomon Sugi at an altitude of 1,300 m. The full round‑trip covers roughly 22 km and takes between nine and eleven hours.

The trail was declared an official path after the rediscovery of Jomon Sugi in 1966. Before that few visitors knew of these ancient cedars in the mountainous interior. The trail passes through primary forests where yakusugi specimens grow alongside other species such as rhododendrons and mosses covering trunks and rocks.
