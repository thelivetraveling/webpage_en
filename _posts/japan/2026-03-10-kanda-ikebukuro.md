# A Stroll Between Origami, Books and Leisure in Ikebukuro and Jimbocho

I start this walk on a clear morning: a route that blends traditional art, libraries and quiet corners to unwind. The day takes you through small museums and cafés, crosses an enchanting bridge, discovers the daruma iconography and ends by immersing ourselves in bustling Sunshine City and Ikebukuro’s arcade pulse.

## Origami Museum — Museum and Folding Workshop

The Origami Museum is a perfect stop for those who appreciate detail. More than just a shop, the space hosts exhibitions and pieces that showcase the evolution of paper folding from its traditional use to contemporary proposals. Here it’s easy to spend time admiring complex models and, if there’s time, sign up for a practical workshop to take home a new technique.

## Hijiri Bridge — A Bridge with Urban Views

Crossing the Kanda‑gawa is Hijiri Bridge, a modern arch that connects neighborhoods and offers excellent spots to contemplate passing trains and water‑level life. It’s a suitable place to pause, take photos and notice how everyday blends with simple yet photogenic architectural elements.

## Kanda Daruma — The Icon That Seeks a Wish

In Kanda it’s common to find shops and stalls dedicated to the daruma, the traditional papier‑mâché doll associated with perseverance and personal goals. Tradition dictates painting only one eye when setting a wish and completing the other once fulfilled. Looking for a local daruma is both a cultural experience and an opportunity to take home an amulet with history.

## Jimbocho Book Town — Paradise of Booksellers and Readers

Jimbocho, without exaggeration, is Tokyo’s mecca for used books. Its streets concentrate specialized bookstores covering everything from academic editions to rare novels and comics. Strolling through Jimbocho means entering and exiting shops where every owner knows their editorial background; it’s ideal for spending time hunting a rare volume or enjoying a conversation with passionate sellers.

### How to Make the Most of Your Visit
- Arrive early: many stores categorize their collections by very specific themes.
- Check out old editions: they often hide finds in history and humanities sections.
- Bring a quick list of authors or titles you’re after to optimize time.

## Canal Cafe — A Breather by the Water

Canal Cafe offers a terrace beside the canal that invites you to pause and enjoy something tranquil. It’s an excellent spot to refresh your legs after hours of walking: cafés, desserts and an atmosphere mixing tourists and locals. The canalised setting has its own history tied to local leisure, and the café leverages that calm to offer a relaxed break on the route.

## Sunshine City — A Microcosm of Leisure and Shopping

Sunshine City is a complex that concentrates shops, leisure, an iconic skyscraper (Sunshine 60), an aquarium and other attractions. Opened in the seventies, the complex was built as a large multifunctional center that remains today one of Ikebukuro’s commercial and recreational hubs. Walking through its levels lets you alternate shopping with cultural visits (such as the Ancient Orient Museum) and viewpoints, making it a practical place to lunch and recharge.

## Ikebukuro Mikado Game Center — Classic Arcade

If you’re in the mood for a retro vibe, Mikado is one of those recreation halls where arcade culture still breathes: fighting machines, scoreboards and enthusiasts mastering specific techniques. It’s an entirely different experience from cultural temples and bookstores: pure community and competitive fun that showcases Tokyo’s urban leisure diversity.

## 7‑Eleven — Japanese Convenience at the End of the Street

A Japanese 7‑Eleven is more than a convenience store: it’s a logistical resource for travelers. From ready‑to‑go meals and ATMs to services like bill payment and tickets, these stores are often a good spot to replenish energy or handle small errands on the go. This route includes a 7‑Eleven with registered coordinates, ideal for marking an meeting point or emergency stop.

## Practical Tips for the Route
- Comfortable footwear: most of the walk is on foot with level changes.
- Cash and card: many second‑hand bookstores accept only cash, though most modern venues take card.
- Hours: bookstores and small museums usually close earlier than shopping centers; check schedules if you’re after something specific.
- Time for workshops: if you want to join an origami workshop, book or arrive early.
- Respect in cultural spaces: ask permission for photos in exhibitions and avoid touching works in display cases.
