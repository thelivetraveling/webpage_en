# Trip to Mount Fuji

Today I had a getaway outside Tokyo, a break from all the hustle and skyscrapers. My plan: a round‑trip journey to **Oshino Hakkai**, a small village at the foot of Mount Fuji known for its crystal‑clear ponds and rural surroundings. From early morning I organized everything to do the whole route by train—a chain of key stations leading to one of the quietest spots I've visited in Japan.

## Asakusa Station — The adventure begins

The day started at **Asakusa Station**, one of Tokyo’s traditional rail nodes. Arriving early always has a special charm: even with little movement, you feel that constant flow of transit that characterises the neighbourhood. Asakusa has historically been a connection point for travellers since the late 19th century when the first urban railway routes were drawn.

The moment I stepped in, I checked connections and schedules. The idea was to make the most of the day and avoid time‑wasting transfers. Although the station has multiple lines, the key was to move quickly to my next stop: **Kanda Station**, where I would switch to a long‑distance train.

## Kanda Station — The perfect link

From Asakusa I arrived at **Kanda Station**, a seamless transfer point to trains heading out of Tokyo. Kanda has been a station since 1919 and has always been crucial for those crossing the city north‑south. Here the rhythm is different: more office workers, more rush, more motion.

I made a quick transfer to the line that took me to **Ōtsuki**, a longer journey where the city starts to fade away bit by bit. During this leg, Tokyo gradually loses density: high buildings give way to residential areas and, slowly, to a mountainous landscape.

## Ōtsuki Station — At Yamanashi’s doorstep

Arriving at **Ōtsuki Station** I noticed the change in pace. You leave behind urban noise and instantly step into Yamanashi prefecture, known for its wine, scenery and as one of the most popular accesses to **Mount Fuji**. This station serves as a strategic point: from here trains depart to several areas near the great volcano, including my next stop: **Fujisan Station**.

Ōtsuki opened in 1901 as part of the railway expansion that linked Tokyo with its rural surroundings. Today it remains a key station for tourists seeking hiking routes, historic villages or outdoor activities. I stretched my legs and prepped my camera: I knew that from this point on, Fuji would begin to peek above the valleys.

## Fujisan Station — Facing the giant

The train entered **Fujisan Station** with a view that always excites. Though weather is not always cooperative, today Mount Fuji was visible clearly, completely snow‑capped at the top and with that perfect silhouette that makes it a national symbol.

Fujisan Station is relatively modern compared to earlier stations. Its design and services are directly aimed at welcoming hikers and travellers looking for activities around the volcano: lake routes, viewpoints, traditional villages and even theme parks. From here buses and local transport head to multiple zones in the Fuji area.

My final destination was already close: **Oshino Hakkai**, a small set of natural ponds fed by meltwater from Mount Fuji itself.

## Oshino Hakkai — Pure water and tradition

I arrived at **Oshino Hakkai** mid‑morning. The contrast with Tokyo could not be greater: traditional houses, watermills, crystal ponds where the background is seen in absolute clarity and a rhythm of life that seems frozen in time.

The history of Oshino Hakkai is deeply natural and cultural at once. Its eight ponds form thanks to water filtered for decades through volcanic rock layers of Fuji, resulting in surprisingly transparent water. Historically these ponds were considered sacred and part of purification routes for pilgrims climbing the mountain.

I walked slowly along the paths that border the ponds. One can feel a curious calm: groups of visitors taking photos, yet at the same time a very particular silence that invites you to observe the surroundings. Small traditional shops offer local sweets, crafts and agricultural products from the area. I tried a local speciality: freshly fried vegetables, perfect for eating while strolling through the village.

### Highlights of the tour
- The clarity of the water: no camera filter does justice to what is seen with the naked eye.
- Traditional houses: perfectly preserved wooden structures.
- Views of Fuji: depending on your spot you can frame the volcano reflected in the ponds.
- The slow rhythm: practically everything is done walking, no rush.
- Easy access from Fujisan Station: perfect for a one‑day excursion.

The entire visit can easily take two or three hours if you spend time at each pond. In my case I wanted to enjoy it calmly before heading back, following the same reverse path: Fujisan → Ōtsuki → Kanda → Asakusa.

## Back to Tokyo

In the afternoon I set out on the return journey. Coming back to Asakusa after a day in Oshino Hakkai feels almost like returning to another dimension: noise, lights, commerce, speed. Perfect to close the excursion with dinner and an evening stroll.

It was a quick, simple getaway, accessible from Tokyo and fully recommended for those looking for a balance between nature, tradition and a touch of history without staying overnight.
