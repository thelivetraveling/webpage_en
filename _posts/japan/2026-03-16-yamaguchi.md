# Yamaguchi, the Kyoto of the West: Between Zen Gardens and Legendary Pagodas

Traveling from Hakata to Yamaguchi is discovering a hidden gem in Japan. While Kyoto captures all tourist attention, Yamaguchi offers an equally rich yet authentic and tranquil cultural experience. This city was nicknamed "the Kyoto of the West" during the Muromachi period when the powerful Ouchi clan recreated here the capital’s culture by investing the wealth from trade with China and Korea.

## Yamaguchi Station: Gateway to the Past

Alighting at Yamaguchi Station is arriving in a city that breathes at another rhythm. With just 200,000 inhabitants, its historical importance far exceeds its size. From the 14th to the 16th century, under the Ouchi clan, it was one of western Japan’s most important cultural centers.

From the station everything is reachable by bus or taxi. To get to Joeiji Temple the easiest way is to take a taxi for about ¥1,500 or the local train two stops to Miyano Station and walk 15 minutes.

## Jyoei-ji Temple & Sesshu's Garden: The Masterpiece of the Zen Master

Joeiji Temple houses one of Japan’s most extraordinary gardens: designed by Sesshu Toyo in the 15th century. Sesshu was a Zen monk, painter and garden designer who revolutionised Japanese art after studying in China between 1467 and 1469. In 1956 he was recognised by the World Peace Council as one of the ten people who contributed most to world culture.

The garden was created around 1450 when Ouchi Masahiro ordered Sesshu to design this Zen space. It has remained intact for over 500 years and was designated a National Historic Site in 1926. Admission costs only ¥300.

The extraordinary feature of the garden is its ability to reveal different perspectives depending on the angle from which you view it. Sesshu intentionally designed it as a kaiyushiki teien, a circular walking garden where each step reveals a new landscape composition. The Musomchi pond symbolizes Zen purity, the rocks represent Taoist sacred islands, and the dry stone waterfall of pyroxene simulates water flow with its splendid masonry.

A small bamboo grove adds verticality and constant whispering. Century‑old pines cast dramatic shadows. In spring cherry blossoms explode into flowers, in autumn maples turn crimson, and in winter snow creates monochrome landscapes worthy of a Chinese ink painting.

You can sit on tatami rooms and contemplate the garden in absolute silence. There is no rush or crowds. Just the wind’s whisper among the bamboo and 500 years of crystallised Zen history in stone, water, and vegetation.

## Rurikoji Temple: National Treasure and Symbol of Yamaguchi

Rurikoji Temple is famous for its five‑storey pagoda, considered a National Treasure of Japan and ranked among the country’s three best along with those at Horyuji in Nara and Daigoji in Kyoto.

The pagoda was commissioned in 1442 by Ouchi Morimi as a memorial for his brother Yoshihiro, who died in 1399 leading a revolt against the shogunate. Its construction took decades and when completed it originally belonged to Koshakuji Temple. In 1690 Rurikoji Temple was moved to this site, adopting the pagoda as its own.

The structure measures 31.2 m in height and its roof is made of cypress bark using the traditional hiwadabuki technique, seen only in three other buildings across Japan. Each floor becomes progressively narrower upward, creating an elegant and balanced silhouette.

Rurikoji’s grounds, also known as Kozan Park, are extensive and beautiful. The park is especially popular during cherry blossom season in February‑March and April. In autumn the maples take on spectacular crimson tones. The pagoda lights up every night until 10 pm, reflecting in the pond and creating one of Japan’s most photogenic nighttime views.

Returning to Hakata after this day left a lasting impression. Yamaguchi holds some of Japan’s most valuable cultural treasures yet remains off the tourist radar. Sesshu’s Zen gardens offer an unreplicable contemplative experience compared to Kyoto’s crowded temples. Rurikoji’s pagoda blends architectural beauty with a dramatic samurai clan history.

The most valuable thing is not just its monuments, but the feeling of discovering something authentic. There are no tour groups with megaphones or endless lines. Just you, the silence of Zen gardens, and centuries of cultural history. If I had to choose between another day in Kyoto or returning to Yamaguchi’s meditative tranquility, I would choose Yamaguchi without hesitation.
