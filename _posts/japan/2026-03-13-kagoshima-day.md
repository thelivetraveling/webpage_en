# Kagoshima and Sakurajima

I decided to take advantage of the day for a trip to Kagoshima from Fukuoka. The idea was to go and return on the same day, although I knew it meant waking up pretty early. The shinkansen connects both cities in just over an hour, so I left the hotel early with a light backpack and the desire to discover a city that I'd read was known as the Naples of the East because of its active volcano, Sakurajima.

## Smile Hotel - Hakata Ekimae

I left the Smile Hotel before it had fully dawned. The hotel fulfilled its role perfectly: perfect location near the station, clean and functional room, and a quick check‑out that didn’t waste my time. Nothing especially memorable, but there’s no need for more when you’re just sleeping a few hours and then continuing the journey.

## Terukuni Shrine

Terukuni Shrine was my first stop in Kagoshima. Founded in 1864, this place honors Shimazu Nariakira, the eleventh lord of the Satsuma domain and a key figure in Japan’s modernization during the late Edo period. The emperor granted him the divine title of Terukuni Daimyojin after his death in 1858, and a year later the shrine was built in his honor.

The first thing I saw as I approached was the huge white torii marking the entrance, visible from several streets away. Crossing the gate, I encountered a peculiarly trimmed tree with branches that looked like wings of an extended bird. It’s one of those details that give each Japanese shrine its own personality.

Nariakira was a visionary who introduced Western technology to Japan, including cameras, telegraphs and modern factories. His legacy is felt not only in this shrine but throughout the city. I paused in front of the main building, where there is a bronze statue of the Satsuma lord.

## Kagoshima (Tsurumaru) Castle Ruins

I walked from the shrine to the Tsurumaru castle ruins, which are just a few minutes away. This castle was built between 1601 and 1604 by Shimazu Tadatsune after the Shimazu clan was defeated at the Battle of Sekigahara. Unlike other Japanese castles with imposing towers and high walls, Tsurumaru was more of a modest fortified residence without a keep. The idea was to demonstrate submission to the Tokugawa shogunate.

What remains today are stone walls, the moat and the Goromon gate, which was rebuilt in 2020. The gate is enormous, about twenty meters tall and wide, and they say it’s the largest in Japan. I was impressed to see bullet holes in the stone walls, remnants of the Anglo‑Satsuma War of 1863 and the Satsuma Rebellion.

The site now houses the Reimeikan Museum, which displays Kagoshima’s history, but I didn’t enter because I had other sites on my list. I contented myself with strolling around the grounds and enjoying the feeling of being in a place where history weighs on every stone.

## Shoko Shuseikan Museum

I took a bus to the Sengan‑en area, where the Shoko Shuseikan Museum is located. This museum sits in the oldest Western‑style stone building in Japan, built in 1865 as a ship machinery factory. It’s part of UNESCO World Heritage related to the industrial revolution of the Meiji era.

Admission to the museum is included with a visit to Sengan‑en Garden, so I took advantage of seeing both. The museum tells the story of 800 years of the Shimazu clan and its modernization project called Shuseikan, which included foundry furnaces, glass and textile factories. Shimazu Nariakira, the same one enshrined at Terukuni, was the driving force behind all this because he feared Japan would be colonized by Western powers.

I especially enjoyed seeing the oldest photographs taken by Japanese people, including one of Nariakira that is the oldest preserved. There were also exhibits on Satsuma Kiriko glass, a cut‑glass technique that nearly disappeared but has been revived.

## Iso Swimming Beach

After the museum, I walked down to Iso beach, which is right next door. This beach is famous for offering direct views of Sakurajima volcano, which rises imposing across the bay. The sand is dark and somewhat rough, mixed with volcanic ash, but the scenery more than compensates.

It’s not a spectacular beach in terms of sand quality, but swimming with an active volcano in the background is something you can’t do at many places in the world. It’s a constant reminder that nature remains more powerful than anything we can build.

## Statue of Okubo Toshimichi

Back toward the station, I passed by the statue of Okubo Toshimichi, another great man from Kagoshima. Okubo was a Satsuma samurai who became a statesman and played a key role in the Meiji Restoration. Together with Saigo Takamori and Kido Takayoshi, he is considered one of the three great nobles who modernized Japan.

With this final stop, I finished my excursion to Kagoshima. I took the shinkansen back to Fukuoka feeling like I had made good use of the day. Kagoshima is a city that breathes history, modernization and respect for its historical figures. And above all, it’s impossible to forget the constant presence of Sakurajima dominating the horizon.
