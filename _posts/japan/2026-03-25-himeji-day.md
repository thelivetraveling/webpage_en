# **Mount Shosha to Himeji: Spiritual Summits and Warlike Ivory**

Our journey begins on Mount Shosha with its ropeway and historic temple, then we descend to the iconic Himeji Castle and finish at the modern Shin-Kobe Station.

## **Mount Shosha Ropeway: The Floating Gateway to the Mountain**

The **Mount Shosha ropeway** (*Shoshazan Ropeway*) is the main access point to the temples of the Engyo-ji complex. Inaugurated to facilitate pilgrimage, this funicular ascends more than 400 meters in about 5 minutes, offering spectacular views of the dense forest and, on clear days, the Seto Inland Sea. It is modern infrastructure that serves as a gateway to an ancient world.

Early in the morning, the ropeway was almost empty. The ride was smooth and silent, rising as if floating above a sea of cedars and maples. The glass cabin offered an ever-widening view of the valley waking up under a clear late-March sky. It was the perfect start — a physical and mental transition separating the plains’ bustle from the peace promised at the summit.

## **Engyo-ji: The Temple in the Clouds of Shosha**

Founded in 966 by the monk Shoku Shonin, **Engyo-ji** is a Tendai temple perched atop Mount Shosha. The complex, with its many halls scattered among the trees, is famous for its contemplative atmosphere and for having served as an ascetic training ground for warrior monks. The main hall, *Maniden*, is a National Treasure of Japan.

Disembarking from the ropeway felt like stepping into another world. The air was cooler and the only sounds were the wind in the tall cedars and the distant chime of a bell. Walking along the stone paths between the wooden pavilions—some reconstructed but others centuries old—inspired a profound calm. The morning mist wrapped around the pagodas, completing a cinematic scene.

## **Himeji Castle: The Everlasting White Heron**

**Himeji Castle** (*Himeji-jō*), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the pinnacle of Japanese feudal castle architecture. Originally built in the 14th century and expanded to its current form in 1609, its elegant, whitish appearance earned it the nickname *Hakuro-jō* (White Heron Castle). It survived wars and bombings intact.

Descending from the mountain and taking the train to Himeji was an absolute contrast. Upon exiting the station, the view of the castle at the end of the avenue is simply spectacular. The main keep, with its six levels and five roofs, stood out against the blue sky. Climbing through its intricate wooden passages—designed to confuse the enemy—felt like touching samurai history.

## **Shin-Kobe Station: The Nexus of Modernity**

**Shin-Kobe Station** is an important terminal of the *Shinkansen* bullet train, inaugurated in 1972 to serve the city. More than just a station, it is an urban complex built into the slope of Mount Rokkō, integrating shopping centers, hotels, and offices. It represents the most modern and dynamic side of the Kansai region.

At the end of the day, arriving at Shin-Kobe felt like returning to the 21st century at full speed. The station’s architecture, with its large atrium and elevated structure, is imposing. While waiting for my connection, I watched the perfect choreography of Shinkansen trains arriving and departing — a spectacle of Japanese precision. It was the perfect ending to a day that moved from medieval spirituality to futuristic efficiency.
