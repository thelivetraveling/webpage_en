# A Perfect Day in Tokyo: Digital Art, Shopping and Nightlife

Tokyo is a city that operates at different speeds depending on the time of day. I spent 24 hours exploring its most fascinating contrasts, from hypnotic digital art installations to neon streets that flicker when sunset falls. This journey took me from the serenity of gardens to the frenetic energy of the red‑light district, tasting everything the Japanese capital offers for travelers who want to experience the best of both worlds.

## teamLab Borderless: When art becomes an immersive experience

My morning began in Azabudai Hills, where the spectacular teamLab Borderless is located. This museum completely reinvented my way of understanding art. Unlike traditional galleries where you observe from a distance, here you become part of the work. The “borderless” concept is literal: installations flow from one room to another without clear boundaries, and every movement of yours affects what you see.

The total space is huge: 10 000 square metres spread over 520 computers and 470 projectors. Although the crowd can be considerable, especially during peak hours, it’s worth it. I recommend spending at least three hours, though many visitors wish to stay longer. Prices vary by date (dynamic pricing), ranging from about 3 800 to 4 800 yen for adults.

## Ebisu Yokocho: A night market in the Showa era

After saturating myself with digital art, I felt the need to anchor myself in something more tangible. Ebisu Yokocho was the perfect answer. This covered alley, hidden beneath a conventional residential building, is a portal to post‑war Tokyo. It’s only a few metres wide but is packed with over twenty tiny izakayas and restaurants, each with its own personality.

Red paper lanterns decorate the entrances, and aromas of yakitori, miso and beer mingle in the air. The eateries here are so small that you often find yourself elbow‑to‑elbow with strangers at the counter. I settled in one serving homemade okonomiyaki. The owners were older people who had operated the same spot for decades, giving it an authenticity impossible to imitate.

## The Shibuya Crossing: The world’s most famous zebra crossing

I couldn’t visit Tokyo without experiencing the legendary Shibuya Crossing, even if only briefly. This intersection, formally known as Scramble Kousaten, has become a global icon of Japanese modernity. Every 47 seconds, when the traffic lights turn green in all directions, between 2 500 and 3 000 people cross simultaneously.

You have to experience it from above to truly appreciate the pattern. The Starbucks across the street offers perfect windows for viewing.

Shibuya Station was built in 1885, but this diagonal crossing as we know it today was formalized in 1973. Nearby is the famous Hachiko statue, the loyal dog that waited for his owner for years after his death, becoming a symbol of loyalty in Japanese culture.

## Takeshita‑dōri: Harajuku’s pedestrian jungle

My next stop was Takeshita‑Street, a totally different sensory experience. This 350‑metre stretch in Harajuku is the world capital of kawaii fashion. Shops stack on top of each other, all competing to capture young visitors’ attention with bright lights, impossibly colourful clothing and accessories that defy logic.

What makes Takeshita unique is that it isn’t a place for sophistication. It’s pure showcase of Japanese youth culture: lace lingerie, cosplay clothes, purikura photo booths where you can snap pictures and decorate them with digital stickers, rainbow‑colour custard creperies, and “everything at 100 yen” stores like the four‑storey Daiso.

I visited on a Sunday morning; the street was so packed that you could barely move. Most customers were pre‑teens and high school students in uniform with their friends. I’d recommend visiting mid‑week mornings or late afternoons to enjoy it best. Although short in distance, an hour of exploration is barely enough to scratch the surface of what’s available here.

## Yoyogi Park: Where Tokyo breathes

After the sensory intensity of Harajuku, Yoyogi Park was a necessary respite. With 54 hectares of open space, it is one of Tokyo’s largest green lungs. The park has a fascinating history: it was the site of Japan’s first motorised flight in 1910, then a military parade ground during World War II, an American barracks after the war, an Olympic villa in 1964, and finally opened to the public as a park in 1967.

Meiji Shrine, dating from 1920, is located within the park and is dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken. The surrounding forest is extraordinary, with autumn ginkgo trees turning everything gold. I spent nearly two hours simply walking, watching people, and imagining how this place would have been a century ago.

## Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden: Three worlds in one

Moving into the afternoon, I headed to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, which contrasts interestingly with Yoyogi Park. While Yoyogi is more wild urban nature, Shinjuku Gyoen is horticultural magnificence. The garden was originally a daimyo residence during the Edo period, then passed to the imperial family in the Meiji era, was destroyed during World War II, and reopened as a public garden in 1949.

What makes it unique is that it contains three completely different garden styles in one place: a traditional Japanese garden with ponds and bridges, a formal French garden with symmetry and rose beds, and an English landscape with wide lawns. The variety is almost disorienting: over 20 000 trees represent hundreds of species. In March, there are about 1 000 cherry trees creating a pink sea of blossoms.

I planned roughly two hours, though I could easily have spent more. The Taiwan Pavilion, a traditional Chinese building built as a wedding gift for Emperor Hirohito in 1927, is particularly interesting. There’s a large greenhouse with over 2 700 tropical and subtropical plant species, including an orchid collection aged over 100 years.

## Golden‑Gai: Entering the bohemian alleys

As night fell, I headed to what many consider Tokyo’s true alternative heart: Shinjuku Golden‑Gai. This place defies superficial description. The six connected alleys host about 200 tiny bars, each with only a few square metres of space.

Golden‑Gai has a fascinating origin. It emerged as a black market after World War II, then turned into a prostitution zone in the ’60s and ’70s, before becoming a haven for artists, photographers, musicians and intellectuals. It survived Tokyo’s real estate speculation partly thanks to protection by the local yakuza, who foresaw that keeping the bohemian area would be more valuable long‑term than demolishing it.

Each bar has its own personality. Some have theatrical décor with golden chandelier lamps. Others are decorated with posters of French films or punk music. Bars are so small they can only accommodate 5 to 10 people. Many don’t even have an English menu. Unwritten rules: no phone‑photography without permission, no shouting, and don’t stay too long if someone is waiting.

## Kabukicho Ichibangai Arch: Crossing into energy

Just next to Golden‑Gai, but in a completely different universe, lies Kabukicho Ichibangai, recognizable by its iconic red neon arch. This is the commercial heart of the Kabukicho district, famous for adult entertainment but also a legitimate destination for tourists who want to experience Tokyo’s nightlife.

The name “Kabukicho” is ironic: it comes from a failed post‑war plan to build a kabuki theatre here. Though the theatre never materialised, the name stuck. Today the area is full of restaurants, karaoke bars, arcade game halls and all kinds of entertainment establishments imaginable. Neon signs compete for attention, creating a visual spectacle that exists in only a few places worldwide.

## Sunshine City: The commercial giant

My last stop was Sunshine City in Ikebukuro, a massive commercial complex that is practically a city on its own. The main building, Sunshine 60, was once the tallest skyscraper in Asia (240 m) when completed in 1978, a title it held until 1985. It now shares space with modern towers but remains an important landmark.

I spent most of my time exploring the shopping mall, which is genuinely huge. There’s a rooftop aquarium, an indoor amusement park called Namja Town, shops dedicated to anime and manga culture, and hundreds of restaurants.

I climbed the observation deck at sunset, when the city began turning into a sea of lights. From here Tokyo reveals itself in all its scale: skyscrapers stretching infinitely in every direction, neon serpentines outlining every street, and the feeling that this metropolis of 37 million people keeps expanding beyond the horizon.

## Reflections at night

Returning to my hotel after midnight, I reflected on the extraordinary contrast of this day. I had moved from suspended digital worlds at teamLab to the cracked alleys of Golden‑Gai. I’d seen young people buying clothes in vibrant Takeshita Street, grandparents enjoying the relative quiet of Yoyogi Park, and middle‑aged tourists like me navigating the organised chaos of Kabukicho.
