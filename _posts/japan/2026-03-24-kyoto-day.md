# **Journey Through the Essence of Kyoto: From Temples to Rail Tracks**

We explored the historic heart of Kyoto, from the iconic Kiyomizu-dera to the tranquil spaces of Umekoji, passing through traditional alleyways and bustling markets.

## **Kiyomizu-dera: The Temple of Pure Water**

**Kiyomizu-dera**, founded in the year 778, long before Kyoto became the imperial capital, is one of Japan’s most revered temples. Its name, meaning “Temple of Pure Water,” comes from the Otowa waterfall flowing within the complex. Its architecture is a marvel—built without a single nail—and its famous wooden stage rises on the hillside, offering panoramic views of the city.

Dawn broke over Kyoto and the late-March air was still crisp. Climbing the steep slope toward the main gate, with the sound of birds and the scent of cedar wood in the air, felt like stepping back in time. Even early in the day, you could already sense the buzz of visitors who, like me, sought that first light over the forest. The promise of cherry blossoms was just starting to show on some of the trees in the grounds.

## **Sanneizaka and Ninnenzaka: Paths Through History**

These two steep alleyways, **Sanneizaka** (Sannén Slope) and **Ninnenzaka** (Ninen Slope), form part of the pilgrimage route to Kiyomizu-dera and are protected by the government to preserve their Edo-period atmosphere. Their stone paving and the wooden façades of the *machiya* (traditional houses) offer an authentic glimpse of old Kyoto, free from modern traffic.

Walking these slopes right after the temple visit was delightful. Shops were opening their wooden doors, displaying fans, Kiyomizu-yaki pottery, and *yatsuhashi* sweets. The sound of my steps on the stone became the soundtrack. Every corner was a photo, with stone lanterns and carefully hidden electric cables that keep the illusion of the 19th century intact.

## **Gion Corner: A Glimpse of Traditional Arts**

**Gion Corner** is a theater and cultural center created to offer visitors an accessible, condensed showcase of Kyoto’s traditional performing arts, known as *Kyo no furusato no geinō* (the arts of the old capital). Its program includes brief performances from seven disciplines, ranging from the tea ceremony to *kyōgen* theater.

After so much walking, sitting in the theater felt respectful and refreshing. Although the show is tourist-oriented, the artists’ quality is undeniable. Seeing up close the precise movements of a maiko dancing *Kyō-mai*, or the restrained power of *gagaku* (court music) in such an intimate space, allows you to appreciate details that would go unnoticed on a large stage. It was a perfect cultural capsule.

## **Nishiki Market: Kyoto’s Kitchen**

Known as “Kyoto’s kitchen,” **Nishiki Market** (*Nishiki Ichiba*) has a history of over 400 years. This narrow covered passage, stretching about 390 meters, hosts around 130 stalls and shops selling fresh ingredients, kitchen tools, and local specialties such as *tsukemono* pickles, *dashi* omelets, and all kinds of skewers.

The contrast upon entering Nishiki was total: from Gion’s quiet to intense aromas and noise. The hallway was a river of people. I stopped at one stall to try *tako tamago* (a small octopus with a quail egg in its head) and at another to buy freshly made *senbei* (rice crackers). The atmosphere was vibrant—a place where you truly understand that food is the soul of this city.

## **Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum**

The **Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum** (*Umekoji Jōkisha*), inaugurated in 1972, is dedicated to preserving the railway heritage of Japan’s steam era. It houses one of the country’s most important collections, with locomotives dating from 1914 to the last one built in 1948. The rounded building, shaped like a locomotive depot, is iconic.

Taking the train line from the city center to here was simple. Upon arrival, the view of the enormous round hall was imposing. Inside, the smell of oil and old metal filled the air. Climbing into the cab of a 1930s locomotive, moving (without touching) the levers, and imagining crossing the country in that steel monster is an experience that fascinates both children and adults. It is a temple for engineering lovers.

## **Umekoji Park: A Green Breather**

**Umekoji Park** (*Umekoji Kōen*), opened to the public in 1995, was built on the grounds of a former locomotive depot and serves as a green lung in the Shimogyo district. Covering about 13.7 hectares, the park includes not only the museum but also ponds, picnic areas, and wide gardens designed for family enjoyment and nature observation.

After the intensity of the museum, strolling through this park was the perfect final touch. The late-March afternoon was pleasant, with families enjoying *hanami* (flower viewing) under cherry trees that were just beginning to bloom. I found a bench near the pond and simply watched as the day bid farewell to Kyoto. The museum’s historic steam train occasionally passes through a section of the park, linking the industrial past with the tranquility of the present through its nostalgic whistle.
