# **Journey Through the Essence of Kyoto: From Temples to Railways**

We explore the historic heart of Kyoto, from the iconic Kiyomizu-dera to the tranquil spaces of Umekoji, passing through traditional alleys and bustling markets.

## **Kiyomizu-dera: The Temple of Pure Water**

**Kiyomizu-dera**, founded in the year 778, long before Kyoto became the imperial capital, is one of the most revered temples in Japan. Its name, meaning "Temple of Pure Water," comes from the Otowa waterfall that flows within the complex. Its architecture is a marvel, built without a single nail, and its famous wooden stage stands on the hillside offering panoramic views of the city.

Dawn was breaking in Kyoto and the late March air was still cool. Climbing the steep slope towards the main gate, with the sound of birds and the scent of cedar wood, was like stepping back in time. Although early, the bustle of visitors who, like me, sought that first light of day over the forest was already noticeable. The promise of cherry blossoms was beginning to become a reality in some trees on the grounds.

## **Sanneizaka and Ninnenzaka: The Paths of History**

These two steep alleys, **Sanneizaka** (Sannen Slope) and **Ninnenzaka** (Ninen Slope), are part of the pilgrimage path to Kiyomizu-dera and are protected by the government to preserve their Edo period atmosphere. Their cobblestones and the wooden facades of their *machiya* (traditional houses) offer an authentic image of old Kyoto, free from modern traffic.

Walking down these slopes right after visiting the temple was a delight. The shops were beginning to open their wooden doors, displaying fans, Kiyomizu-yaki ceramics, and *yatsuhashi* sweets. The sound of my footsteps on the stone was the main character. Every corner was a photo opportunity, with the stone lanterns and electrical cables carefully hidden so as not to break the illusion of being in the 19th century.

## **Gion Corner: A Glimpse of Traditional Arts**

**Gion Corner** is a theater and cultural center established to offer visitors an accessible and concentrated sample of Kyoto's traditional performing arts, known as *Kyo no furusato no geinō* (the arts of the old capital). Its program includes short performances of seven disciplines, from the tea ceremony to *kyōgen* theater.

After so much walking, it was a relief to sit in the theater. Although the show is aimed at tourists, the quality of the artists is undeniable. Seeing up close the precision of a maiko's movements during the *Kyō-mai* dance or the contained power of *gagaku* (court music) in such an intimate space allows one to appreciate details that would go unnoticed on a large stage. It was a perfect cultural capsule.

## **Nishiki Market: The Kitchen of Kyoto**

Known as "the kitchen of Kyoto," **Nishiki Market** (*Nishiki Ichiba*) has a history of over 400 years. This narrow covered passageway, stretching about 390 meters, houses around 130 stalls and shops selling fresh ingredients, kitchen utensils, and local specialties like *tsukemono* pickles, *dashi* omelets, and all kinds of skewers.

The contrast upon entering Nishiki was total: from the silence of Gion to the hustle and intense smells. The aisle was a river of people. I stopped at a stall to try a *tako tamago* (a small octopus with a quail egg in its head) and at another to buy freshly made *senbei* (rice crackers). The atmosphere was vibrant, a place where you understand that gastronomy is the soul of this city.

## **Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum**

The **Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum** (*Umekoji Jōkisha*), opened in 1972, is dedicated to preserving the railway heritage of the steam era in Japan. It houses one of the most important collections in the country, with locomotives dating from 1914 to the last one manufactured in 1948. The rounded building, resembling a locomotive shed, is iconic.

Taking the train line from the center to here was easy. Upon arrival, the sight of the huge round shed is imposing. Inside, the smell of oil and old metal fills the senses. Climbing into the cabin of a locomotive from the 1930s, handling (without touching) the levers, and imagining crossing the country with that steel monster is an experience that fascinates both children and adults alike. It is a temple for engineering enthusiasts.

## **Umekoji Park: A Green Respite**

**Umekoji Park** (*Umekoji Kōen*), opened to the public in 1995, was built on the grounds of an old locomotive depot and serves as a green lung in the Shimogyo district. Covering an area of approximately 13.7 hectares, the park houses not only the museum but also ponds, picnic areas, and extensive gardens designed for family enjoyment and nature observation.

After the intensity of the museum, strolling through this park was the perfect finishing touch. The late March afternoon was pleasant, with families having *hanami* (flower viewing) under the cherry trees that were beginning to bloom. I found a bench near the pond and simply watched the day bid farewell in Kyoto. The museum's historic steam train occasionally passes through a section of the park, connecting the industrial past with the tranquility of the present with its whistle.
