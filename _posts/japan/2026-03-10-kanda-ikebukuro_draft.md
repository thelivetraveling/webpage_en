## Origami Museum  

The **Origami Museum** is a space dedicated to the art of paper folding, a discipline that dates back to the 17th century but continues to evolve. Its temporary exhibitions showcase pieces by artists from around the world, and the interactive area lets you try techniques ranging from traditional *noshi* to more abstract figures. The building, with contemporary architecture, blends into Ikebukuro’s neighborhood, also offering a shop with materials and reference books.

## Hijiri Bridge  

The **Hijiri Bridge** crosses the small canal that separates Ikebukuro from the Shinjuku‑nishiguchi district. Though it doesn’t have the fame of Asakusa’s bridges, its name—meaning “sacred bridge”—reminds us of the old Hijiri‑ji temple that once stood nearby. Today the bridge is a crossing frequented by locals who use it to reach the food market and riverside cafés.

## Kanda Daruma  

On Kanda‑dōri street you’ll find **Kanda Daruma**, a shop that sells the famous wooden dolls without eyes, which according to custom receive one pupil when a wish is made and the second once it’s fulfilled. Founded in 1954, the store keeps its original wooden façade and offers a wide variety of sizes and colours. In addition to darumas, the shop displays ceramic objects and paper items reflecting local craftsmanship.

## Jimbocho Book Town  

The **Jimbocho** neighbourhood is known as Tokyo’s “book paradise.” Its narrow streets house over 200 bookstores, from second‑hand boutiques to specialist academic text shops. Here you’ll find rare editions of Japanese literature, art magazines and exhibition catalogues. The bohemian atmosphere invites you to get lost among shelves that stretch across several floors, while the scent of old paper envelops visitors.

## Canal Cafe  

Just a few metres from Hijiri Bridge is **Canal Cafe**, a venue with a terrace overlooking the tranquil artificial canal. Its menu combines classic European pastries with certified matcha tea. The interior, decorated with paper lamps and bamboo furniture, creates an intimate ambience ideal for resting after a long walk through the area.

## Ikebukuro Mikado Game Center  

The **Ikebukuro Mikado Game Center** is a retro arcade hall where lovers of classic games can try machines such as *Space Invaders* or *Dance Dance Revolution*. The venue maintains an ’80s aesthetic, with neon lights and iconic character posters. In addition to video games it offers a *pachinko* area and a small café serving energy drinks and Japanese snacks.

Its presence in the urban landscape is so constant that it has become a reference point for travellers looking for a quick stop before continuing their day in Tokyo.
