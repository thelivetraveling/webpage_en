# Kumamoto and Its Resilient Castle: A Day Between History and Modernity

Kumamoto is a city that breathes history and resilience. Its castle, considered one of Japan’s three most important along with Himeji and Matsumoto, is more than an Edo‑era fortification: it is the symbol of a community that refuses to give up. Leaving Hakata by bullet train early in the morning toward this Kyushu capital is a journey into samurai past, but also into a present striving to preserve its heritage after the devastating 2016 earthquakes.

## Kumamoto Castle: The Fortress That Challenged History

Arriving at Kumamoto Castle and seeing its imposing black obsidian walls rise over the city evokes a mix of admiration and sorrow. The story of this castle is epic: built in 1607 by Kato Kiyomasa, a brilliant military commander who served under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, it was designed to be practically impregnable. It fulfilled its mission for more than four centuries, surviving sieges and battles, including the bloody Satsuma Rebellion of 1877.

But in April 2016, nature did what no army had achieved: severely damage the structure. Two consecutive earthquakes of magnitudes 6.5 and 7.3 shook Kumamoto, killing over 200 people and injuring thousands. The castle suffered historic damage: nearly a third of its stone walls collapsed, towers cracked, the tenshukaku (main tower) was seriously damaged, and the emblematic tiles deliberately designed to fall first during earthquakes fell in tons.

The castle grounds cover several hectares, with centuries‑old trees, deep moats and various secondary structures. Uto Tower is one of the few that survived the 1877 siege and dates back to the original construction period. Near San-no-Maru Park sits Hosokawa Gyobu‑tei, the former residence of the Hosokawa clan, a traditional wooden mansion with a beautiful Japanese garden.

## Kumamoto City Hall Observatory: Urban Perspective

Just a few minutes walking from the castle is Kumamoto City Hall, whose observatory on the 14th floor offers free panoramic views of the city. It isn’t one of the most publicised tourist spots, but precisely because of that it’s charming: few foreign visitors reach here.

From above you see the scale of the castle and its grounds, the spread of the modern city with low‑rise buildings respecting the silhouette of the tenshukaku, and on clear days even the smoky Mount Aso in the distance. It is the perfect place to geographically contextualise everything you’ll visit during the day.

The building itself is an example of modern Japanese government architecture: functional, efficient, with open spaces that invite citizens. There’s a small café where you can have coffee while watching the city. The visit takes no more than 20 minutes but adds valuable perspective.

## OMO Cafe: Design and Flavor with Castle Views

After all that walking, a stop at OMO Café was mandatory. This café is part of the OMO5 Kumamoto by Hoshino Resorts hotel, opened in April 2023, and has quickly become one of the city’s most interesting spaces.

The café’s design is spectacular: high ceilings, minimalist décor with wood touches and tones inspired by Kumamoto’s mountains and waterfalls. But the best is the Deco‑Boco terrace (literally “irregular” in Japanese), inspired by the castle’s kuruwa (walled enclosures). From here you have direct views of the main tower of Kumamoto Castle, with the café’s modernity contrasting against 400 years of history.

I ordered a latte and one of their famous mixed gelatos with three flavours. The combination of vanilla, sweet sweet potato and the salty touch of Higo Taiko cookies was perfect. Prices are reasonable considering location and quality: the mixed gelato costs ¥650.

## Shimotori Shopping Arcade: Kumamoto’s Commercial Heart

Walking from the castle area to Shimotori Shopping Arcade is stepping into Kumamoto’s daily bustle. This commercial gallery is the largest in the prefecture, with 511 m length, 15 m width and 10 m height. Its resin crystal roof lets natural light flood the space during the day, while at night LED lighting creates a cozy atmosphere.

Shimotori opened as an enclosed arcade in 1970 and has since become the city’s commercial epicentre. Unlike its neighbour Kamitori, which has a more serene and traditional vibe, Shimotori is dynamic, noisy and full of life. During the day it functions as the main shopping district, but after 21:00 it transforms into Kumamoto’s nightlife hub.

For otaku culture lovers, the northern part of Shimotori is a paradise with several stores specialising in anime, manga and video games. There are also pachinko parlours, bowling alleys and karaoke everywhere.

## Suizenji Jojuen Garden: The Garden That Recreates Japan in Miniature

Taking the tram from downtown to Suizenji Koen takes about 15 minutes for ¥180. Suizenji Jojuen is one of Kumamoto’s least‑known treasures for Western tourists, but absolutely essential.

This 64‑hectare strolling garden was created in 1632 by Hosokawa Tadatoshi, the first feudal lord of Higo (Kumamoto) after the Hosokawa clan arrived. During a falconry outing, Tadatoshi was impressed by the crystal spring water emerging from the ground, fed by underground aquifers connected to Mount Aso. He decided to build a Buddhist temple called Suizenji and a tea house there.

  <figcaption class="align-right">Part of Jojuen Garden by <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:663highland">663highland</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Successive generations of the Hosokawa family expanded the garden until it became a kaiyushiki teien (circular strolling garden) of refined Momoyama style. In 1671 the work was completed and named Jojuen, referencing a line from Tao Qian’s classic Chinese poem “Come Away Home”.

The most striking feature is the miniature recreation of the 53 stations of the Tokaido, the major route that connected Edo (Tokyo) to Kyoto during the Edo period. This includes an artificial hill perfectly symmetrical evoking Mount Fuji, located east of the central lake. Though the mountain is only a few metres high, its conical shape is unmistakable and photogenic.

The central pond is constantly fed by pure spring water so clear you can see every stone at the bottom and koi swimming lazily. Two stone bridges dating from the Meiji era (1868‑1912) cross different points of the lake. The circular walk takes you along carefully raked gravel paths, passing between centuries‑old pines, cherry trees, wisteria, bamboo groves and meticulously designed landscape compositions.

## SAKURA MACHI Kumamoto: The New Face of the City

Back downtown, the last stop of the day was SAKURA MACHI Kumamoto, a multifunctional complex opened in September 2019 that has changed the face of this part of the city. This large‑scale project combines a bus terminal, shopping centre, hotel, Kumamoto‑jo Hall event venue, TOHO cinemas, offices and condominiums, all in a contemporary design inspired by rice‑field terraces.

The roof hosts Sakura Machi Garden, a modern garden inspired by the historic Yoshun Tei garden once owned by the Hosokawa family. There’s a playground with a slide and water play area, plus the Kumamoto Castle Terrace where you can photograph a huge Kumamon statue against the castle backdrop. At night, the garden lights up creating a romantic atmosphere.

Kumamoto is not just a tourist destination; it’s a lesson in resilience, a demonstration that cultural heritage deserves to be defended against any adversity, and a reminder that history and modernity can coexist beautifully when there’s shared will and vision.
