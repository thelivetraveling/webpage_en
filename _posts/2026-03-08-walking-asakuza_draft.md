## Asakusa Nishi-sandō Shopping Street

The Nishi‑sandō commercial street lies on the west side of Sensoji Temple. This covered gallery, about a hundred meters long, stands out for its wooden floor—a rarity in Japanese public roads. Originally built in 1954, it was completely renovated in 2013 adopting a festive style that evokes traditional neighborhood celebrations.

The shops specialize in items related to matsuri and Japanese festivals. Among them are kimono stores, traditional dance costumes, festival accessories, and even ceremonial swords. The atmosphere recalls the old monzen‑machi, those commercial villages that sprang up around large temples during the Edo period.

## Sensō-ji Temple

Sensoji is Tokyo’s oldest Buddhist temple. According to legend, two fisherman brothers found a Kannon statue in the Sumida River during the 7th century. The village chief recognized its sanctity and turned his home into a small shrine so villagers could venerate it.

In 645 the first formal temple for Kannon worship was founded. Though the buildings have been rebuilt multiple times, the temple remains one of Japan’s most visited sites with nearly thirty million visitors annually. The Kaminarimon gate and Nakamise shopping street precede access to the main hall.

## Asakusa Shrine

The Asakusa Shrine, also known as Sanja‑sama, honors the three founders of Sensoji Temple. It is located beside the main temple and forms part of the same sacred complex. It is one of Tokyo’s most famous Shinto shrines.

The shrine celebrates the Sanja Matsuri festival each May, one of the city’s most spectacular celebrations. For three days, portable shrines (mikoshi) parade through the neighborhood streets in a massive procession that attracts millions and reflects Asakusa’s festive tradition.

## Asakusa Hanayashiki

Hanayashiki is Japan’s oldest amusement park. It opened in 1853 during the Edo period as a botanical garden with peonies and chrysanthemums. In 1872, the first entertainment facilities were added showcasing animals and curiosities.

The park houses Japan’s oldest operating roller coaster, running since 1953. Despite its small size of roughly five thousand square meters, it maintains a nostalgic atmosphere with retro attractions. It was demolished during World War II and rebuilt in 1947 preserving that old‑world charm.

## Taito Kuritsu Fuji Park

This small neighborhood park in Asakusa serves as a green rest area for local residents. It is part of the public space network managed by the Taito ward. The park offers playgrounds and shaded areas.

Neighborhood parks like this play an important role in everyday life for locals. They serve as community gathering points where families can enjoy outdoor moments amid Tokyo’s dense urban fabric.

---

## Taito Kuritsu Nihonzutsumi Park

Nihonzutsumi Park is located in northern Asakusa. Like other green spaces in the Taito ward, it provides recreational areas and wooded zones that offer a respite in an urban setting.

These municipal parks maintain historical connections to neighborhood development. The Nihonzutsumi area was part of commercial routes linking Asakusa with other districts during the Edo period and retains that character as a passage between different traditional areas.

---

## Yoshiwara Park

Yoshiwara Park occupies land that formerly belonged to the Yoshiwara district, established in 1617 as the only licensed red‑light district of its kind in Edo. After the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923, a fire devastated the area and more than five hundred people perished at Benten‑ike pond.

The park was created as a memorial and reconciliation space. Today it retains a quiet atmosphere surrounded by residential zones. Visitors can reflect on the district’s complex history while enjoying a green space that contrasts its turbulent past.

---

## Yoshiwara Shrine

Yoshiwara Shrine was founded in 1873 through the merger of five Inari shrines that protected the old district. Women working in Yoshiwara venerated these deities seeking protection and prosperity. The current shrine was rebuilt in 1968.

It is dedicated to Benzaiten, one of Asakusa’s seven good‑fortune deities. The goddess is especially popular among artists and women who wish to fulfill their desires. The Aizome cherry tree planted in 2013 recalls the original tree that stood beside Yoshiwara’s main gate.

## Men Mitsui

Men Mitsui is a ramen restaurant recognized by Michelin with a Bib Gourmand distinction. It specializes in shoyu ramen with clear broth and hand‑made thick noodles. The venue has just eleven seats at the bar.

The establishment uses a numbered ticket system an hour before opening. Ramen presentation is meticulous, and the chef prepares each bowl in front of diners. The restaurant closes on Mondays and Sundays, maintaining limited hours that reflect its artisanal dedication.

## Kappabashi Cooking‑Utensil Street

Kappabashi is an 800‑meter commercial street dedicated exclusively to kitchen utensils and restaurant equipment. About one hundred sixty shops sell from Japanese knives and ceramics to plastic food replicas known as sampuru.

The street began in 1912 with tool and used furniture stores. After World War II it developed into a district specialized in professional cookware. The name comes from merchant Kihachi Kappaya who invested in drainage infrastructure during the 19th century to protect Asakusa from flooding.

## Don Quijote Uguisudani

Don Quijote is a chain of large department stores selling everything from electronics and cosmetics to food and souvenirs. The Uguisudani branch offers everything from electronics and cosmetics to foods and souvenirs. It stays open until late at night.

The establishment is popular among international visitors for its wide range of Japanese products. It accepts tax‑refund returns for tourists with passports. The Uguisudani store is near the station of the same name on the JR Yamanote line.

## Ginza Yanaka

Yanaka is a traditional neighborhood that preserves the atmosphere of old Tokyo. The Ginza Yanaka area is characterized by its narrow streets with family shops, small temples and wooden houses. It is part of the Yanesen area together with Nezu and Sendagi.

The district escaped destruction during World War II bombings. That’s why it retains historic buildings and an urban layout that recalls the Edo period. Visitors can stroll through alleys full of traditional crafts, retro cafés and art galleries in a setting far from modern bustle.
