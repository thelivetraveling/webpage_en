## Fukuoka Airport

Fukuoka Airport is one of Japan’s most accessible airports. Located just three kilometres from the city centre, it was formerly Itazuke Air Base during the U.S. occupation. The airport handles both domestic and international flights connecting Kyushu with the rest of the country and nearby Asian destinations.

The domestic terminal is separated from the international by a free shuttle system. Travelers find multiple services including restaurants specialising in Fukuoka’s typical tonkotsu ramen. The airport operates roughly two hundred flights daily, making it one of the busiest in western Japan.

## Yakushima Airport

The small Yakushima Airport primarily receives regional flights from Fukuoka, Osaka and Kagoshima. Located on the island’s east coast, the airport was built to facilitate access to this remote territory situated sixty kilometres south of Kyushu. The 1,500‑metre runway allows operations of smaller aircraft.

Facilities are modest but functional, with a single terminal reflecting the island’s tranquil character. From the airport local buses depart connecting the main population centres of Miyanoura and Anbo. The flight from Fukuoka takes about an hour, offering spectacular views of the East China Sea.

## Yakushima Green Hotel

Yakushima Green Hotel is located on the outskirts of Anbo with privileged sea views. This traditional three‑star hotel combines Japanese‑style rooms with futons and Western‑style rooms with beds. All rooms feature private bathrooms, television and a fridge, maintaining a cosy atmosphere without unnecessary luxury.

The establishment offers gender‑separated public baths and a hot stone sauna that invite rest after mountain hikes. The Japanese breakfast is served in the dining room overlooking the East China Sea while dinner offers local specialties in kaiseki format. The hotel is ten minutes by car from the airport and near the Chuo bus stop.

## Clear Coin Laundry

Clear Coin Laundry offers basic wash and dry services near the Anbo area. Like many facilities on Yakushima, the shop is small but fulfils its role perfectly for travellers who need to wash clothes during extended stays on the island. Such establishments are essential in remote places where commercial options are limited.

Operation is simple via automatic machines that accept 100‑ and 500‑yen coins. Wash cycles last about thirty minutes while drying takes another thirty. Many hikers traversing the island’s trails use these services before continuing their route to the central mountain yakusugi forests.
